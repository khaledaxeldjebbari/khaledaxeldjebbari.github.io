## My name is **Khaled Axel Djebbari** and I’m a **PhD Researcher in Environmental Health & Engineering**
### Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering, University of Connecticut

**Research interests:**  
I study emergent contaminants—including PFAS, pesticides, and microplastics—with a focus on their interactions, environmental fate and transport, mechanistic toxicology, and reactive transport across soils, aquatic systems, and wastewater infrastructure. My work also explores next-generation treatment technologies to mitigate these contaminants. Views expressed here are my own.

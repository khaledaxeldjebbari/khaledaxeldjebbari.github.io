## **PhD Researcher in Environmental Engineering**
### **PFAS–Microplastic Interactions · Environmental Fate & Transport · Environmental Health**

I study the mechanistic behavior, environmental mobility, and health impacts of PFAS–microplastic co-contaminants using multiscale experimentation, molecular simulation, mechanistic toxicology, and reactive transport modeling.
